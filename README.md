# Periodic Table of AI Technologies

A single-page reference that presents AI technologies in a periodic-table style layout. Explore models, techniques, architectures, training methods, applications, tools, metrics, and core concepts in one place.

## Features

- **Periodic-style grid** — 50+ AI “elements” arranged by category
- **Search** — Filter by name or symbol (e.g. GPT, RAG, BERT)
- **Category filters** — Models, Techniques, Architectures, Training, Applications, Tools, Metrics, Concepts
- **Legend** — Color-coded categories (Foundation Models, AI Techniques, Architectures, etc.)
- **Detail modal** — Click any card for definition, use cases, key features, and related concepts
- **Responsive** — Layout adapts to different screen sizes; table scrolls horizontally on narrow viewports
- **No build step** — Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (double-click or **File → Open**).
2. Or serve the folder locally, for example:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

No npm, node, or other dependencies are required.

## Tech

- Single self-contained **HTML** file
- **CSS** (variables, grid, flexbox, responsive breakpoints)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks)
- Fonts: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit), [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) via Google Fonts
